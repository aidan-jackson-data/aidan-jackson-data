Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

Formerly a chemical engineer, I am now a data scientist with interests in both research and commerical application of statistics and machine learning. For a better view of my work, please visit https://aidan-jackson-data.github.io/.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an NLP research project that investigates a new, unique evaluation process for the translation ability of models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the history of computer vision techniques, to better understand the development of the current state of the art.
- 💬 Ask me about statistics based techniques for time series forecasting and process control.

Repo Languages:

(Note: This is heavily skewed since Rmd files are not counted for the R programming language. Instead, the API ignores them and they are not counted at all. Also, almost all of my Jupyter Notebooks are used with Python.)
